# Change Log

All user visible changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/), as described
for Rust libraries in [RFC #1105](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1105-api-evolution.md)
For any named minimal supported Rust version I guarantee that it is possible to build vgs with the
default features enabled using some set of dependencies. Those set of dependencies is not necessarily
an up to date version of the specific dependency.

## 0.1.0 - 2022-04-21

* Initial release - no useful features yet (on purpose)
